# SQL Essential Training Project: Missing Money Matters

This GitHub repository contains the project "Missing Money Matters" completed as part of the "SQL Essential Training" course on LinkedIn Learning by Tech Educator & Best-Selling Author Walter Shields. 

## Project Description

The project involves analyzing the WSDA Music company's financial data to account for a discrepancy in the company's financials that occurred between the years 2011 and 2012. The project is divided into three challenges, each with a set of queries to perform in-depth analysis of the database. The aim is to get a list of suspects, narrow the list, and pinpoint the prime suspect(s). 

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the WSDA Music database, which contains information about customers, employees, invoices, and transactions.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have SQL installed on your machine. You can download SQL from the official website: https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/.

Once you have SQL installed, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/1HD22/SQL-Essential-Training-Project.git
```

## Analysis

The analysis of the WSDA Music database is done using SQL queries, including SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY. The analysis includes querying the database to retrieve specific information about transactions, customers, employees, sales reps, commission payouts, and more.

## Conclusion

This project is a great way to learn more about SQL and how it can be used to analyze financial data. By completing this project, you will have a better understanding of SQL queries and techniques and how they can be applied to real-world scenarios.
